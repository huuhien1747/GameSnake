test file: TestThread
** Create a Thread:
	* extends Thread class
	* implements Runable interface
* Class extended java.lang.Thread
* Thread.start() : run thread
* Thread.run() : you can write solving code in this method
* Thread.sleep(milisecond_time) : thread sleep in milisecond_time

note 1: cannot call start() method (this method was call by main method) 2 time, use run() method 
	to execute code and run was call by current thread, call start 2 time will throw 
	IllegalStateException
